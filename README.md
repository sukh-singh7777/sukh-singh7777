### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Sukh!

I'm an aspiring web developer and Python programmer with a passion for creating useful and engaging applications. I've worked on various projects including games, utility applications, and management systems that showcase my growing skills in Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of my key projects:
- **Mad Libs Game**: A fun word game where user inputs generate dynamic and funny stories.
- **To-Do List Application**: A simple app for organizing tasks, built using Python.
- **School Management System**: A comprehensive tool to manage student records, built using Python.

I am constantly improving my skills and expanding my knowledge in web development and data analysis, with a focus on lead generation strategies. Open to collaborations and opportunities to work on exciting projects!
